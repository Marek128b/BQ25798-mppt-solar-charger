This project is a compact, efficient battery charger based on the TI BQ25798 IC. It is capable of charging 1s to 4s lithium-ion battery packs with up to 5A output current. The integrated buck-boost converter supports a wide range of input sources, including USB-C and solar panels.

Key features:
- I2C control interface for full configuration and monitoring
- Integrated Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to maximize efficiency from solar panels
- Automatic input source detection and power path management
- Programmable charging profiles and safety features
- Ideal for portable, off-grid, and solar-powered embedded applications

This board is suitable for developers building energy-efficient, battery-powered systems that rely on variable power sources like small PV panels.
